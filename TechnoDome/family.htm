<p><font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:16" >Lets begin a story of a Family of 7 (seven)

is an important part of the society which he never felt in the same way.</font></p>
<p><b>Mrs Rahman,</b> 35, a house-wife, is the lady in the house. She is a
house-wife. Time is spent by taking care of her children, taking her little
Tinku &amp; Mina to the school, cooking &amp; lots of other household works. Few days back, she used to pass
her lazy hours by watching cable TV<font face="Times New Roman">.
Now-a-days, she has found something different with </font><font face="Matisse ITC">Omni
TV Net's</font><font face="Times New Roman">. She is having a cooking lesson
from the Net's Library where she found a lot of recipes for some Chinese dishes
which she wanted to learn long back. She has learnt to operate personal
computer. She can talk to the neighbors by the Net's video phone service after
hours. Now-a-days, expenditures for children's education, transport, daily
necessaries, clothing, health etc is expanding. She has planned to contribute to
the family's growing needs. She is now making home made pickles and marketing it
through the Net's <b>'BAZAR'</b> page (a page for personalized advertisements).
She is also having her typing lessons. She never engaged herself with any
professional courses since her graduation after her marriage. Well she intends
to earn by doing some jobs at the <i>Data Entry </i>sector from the Net's <i><b>Job
Offering Page</b></i>. She is having a dream of earning a lot to cope with the
growing expenses now-a-days.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">She has quite a free time at home. She does not
have to go and take her children to the school since the whole school is at
home. Yes, two of her Tinku &amp; Mina are students of the Net's Virtual School.
This school provides all the facilities of a school in conventional manner. No
problem of security during taking her children to the school, or a fear of
probable hijacking is no more.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In fact, it is the </font><font face="Matisse ITC">Omni-TV
Net</font><font face="Times New Roman">, which has fulfilled all her dreams and
the desires which remained unanswered.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Shakib, 17,</b> is the eldest son of the
family. After the SSC exam, he is learning how to operate a PC. He is also
learning some softwares like MS Word, MS Excel &amp; some graphics sotfwares as
well from the Net's virtual computer training centre at a very low cost. He is
now dreaming to be a computer engineer. He is earning an extra money from the
Net's Data Entry Jobs. He has given an advertisement in the Net's personalized
advertisement page for private tuitions. He is getting some calls in response to
the ad. He is taking preparation to get an admission in to a good college for
which the Net is providing a good service.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Mina, 14,</b> is the second&nbsp; child of
the family. She is a student of class IX at the Net's Virtual School. She is a
good computer operator. She can browse through the world wide web. She is in a
process of learning a lot than a girl of her age. She can cook. She had some
cooking lessons from the Net's Cooking school. Last month, her father was
astonished having a nice dish all cooked by his little daughter. She can compose
her e-mails to her uncle's family in the States all by herself. Last month she
sent a greeting card by e-mail to her cousin at her birthday. In fact, her life
is running in some different way than she had few years back.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Tinku, 9,</b> is the youngest one in the
family. Once he may be called somewhat like a spoilt child. His mother was
tensed all the time when handling this child of hers. </font><font face="Matisse ITC">Omni-TV
Net</font><font face="Times New Roman"> has relieved her off the tension. Tinku
can type, travel through the web, play video games, and a lot more options he is
discovering with the </font><font face="Matisse ITC">Omni-TV
Net. </font><font face="Times New Roman">He is a student of the Net's virtual
school. He can have classes, and extended helps from private tutors through the
Net's concerned services. He is also a member of the Net's <b>'Children's
Educational Page'</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"> </font>from where he
can learn a lot about geography, history, politics and more. Now, Tinku wonders
what else there can be that can't be done on <font face="Matisse ITC">Omni-TV
Net.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Sheikh Abdur Rahman, 65</b>, is the senior Mr
Rahman, the father of Mr Rahman. He is a retired governmental employee. His wife
passed away few years back leaving him alone. He caught diseases like diabetes,
high blood pressure and various other old timer's companions at this stage of
life. Once he felt most of the time alone but now the whole scene is different.
He pass his time playing chess, having a chat with Mr Ahmed, 62, a neighbour by
the Net's video phone.</font> He can talk and see his another son in the States
live. He is very happy when he talks &amp; watch his grand children growing
though living in a great distant. Few days back, the senior Mr Rahman had a
heart attack at 3 am in the night. Everybody was worried about what may happen
to him. The Net's <b>On-Line Medical Centre</b> did a great job. Their stand-by
medical officer gave necessary advices and they called the ambulance too. Mr
Rahman was transferred to the Hospital in no time. Mr Rahman survived that&nbsp;
attack as the doctors said it was done only by a quick medical attention (
provided by the Net ). Now-a-days, he is not worried about his health anymore.
It is the Net who can take care of him all through the hours of a day. It is Mr
Rahman's favourite pass-time as well surfing the world wide web with his dear
grand son. It's a great fun too. </p>

<p><b>Hasib&nbsp; Khan, 32,&nbsp;</b> is the brother-in-law of Mr Rahman, ie,
the younger brother of Mrs Rahman. Hasib had his graduation in his home town,
Madaripur and had been unemployed since then. Once he had been a black sheep of
the family. At one time, he got mixed up with the local hooligans, and, in a
real sense, he became a problem to Mr Rahman's family. The whole scene changed
when he had <font face="Matisse ITC">Omni-TV Net</font> within his reach.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:

office management (word processing, spreadsheet analysis, database
management,etc.).In fact, Omni-Tv net put options for Hasib to be have a carrier
of a graphic designer,draftsman,audio/video editor, and more and more options
one can dream of. Hasib chose the carrier of a graphics designer and discovered
his talent in this very field. Now-a-days, he is working in a designing firm and
planning to have his own address and bring his mom to build a family of his own.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> </p>
