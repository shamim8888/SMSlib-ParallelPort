Commercial License
------------------

A nonexclusive commercial license is available for cgic.
The commercial license grants you the right to make use of 
cgic in your applications without the need for a credit
notice of any kind. Under the commercial license, applications 
developed with cgic may be redistributed freely. cgic may
not be used to create a development tool which passes on
substantially all of the capabilities of the cgic library
to the user of the tool, unless that tool is strictly for use
within applications developed by the holder of the commercial 
license.  Such libraries may of course be distributed under the 
normal non-commercial license terms, which require a credit
notice (see above).

The nonexclusive commercial license is available
for a one-time fee of $500. Please contact the author,
boutell@boutell.com, for payment details.
