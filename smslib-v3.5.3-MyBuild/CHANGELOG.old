22. SMSServer Bug: Outbound messages were always retrieved from the interfaces, no matter if there are outbound gateways defined.
23. SMSLib: Implemented an alternative startService(boolean) method which, if called with "false", may attempt to start all gateways but does not fail if some gateways fail to start. If called with "true" the behavior is the same as before.
24. SMSLib: CommTest more error-friendly (http://code.google.com/p/smslib/issues/detail?id=83).
25. SMSLib: Motorola G20/24 compatibility (http://code.google.com/p/smslib/issues/detail?id=86).

[v3.2.1 Feb 21, 2008]
1. SMSLib: Change in regular expressions for the detection of inbound voice calls.
2. SMSLib: MS SQL script for inbound calls' table was missing.
3. SMSLib: Masking of the IMSI info is not hardcoded in code, its now controlled via the Settings.MASK_IMSI setting (contributed by Sebastian Just).
4. SMSLib: Removed the Service parameter from Gateway constructors.
5. SMSLib: Added recommended command line option "-runonce" in SMSSvr. When run with this option, SMSSvr will just run its process cycle once and exit.
6. SMSLib: Code refactoring for Service's sendMessage(xxx) and queueMessage(xxx) methods.
7. SMSLib: All methods sendMessage() and queueMessage() now follow the OutboundMessage's "gatewayId" member field.
8. SMSLib: Change in default Router logic in order to follow the selected gatewayId of the message.
9. SMSLib: Router error, the NO_ROUTE error did not set the message status to FAILED.
10. SMSLib: Added Settings.SERIAL_RTSCTS_OUT which, when set, will enable hardware control for outbound serial port traffic. This may be required for some modems/phones.
11. SMSLib: Fixed an issue which caused unreadable multi-part messages for Unicode encoding.
12. SMSLib: Fixed the issue where multiple messages arrive during processing and lead to a library deadlock. Other minor lock improvements.
13. SMSLib: Changed the default serial driver behavior from writing characters to writing bytes. This helped some friends communicate with their phones.


[v3.2 Jan 14, 2008]
1. SMSLib: Classes moved to packages. New packages are: org.smslib.http, org.smslib.modem, org.smslib.modem.athandler.
2. SMSLib: Service methods get/set Queue Retries/Delay are removed. Use the system properties "smslib.queue.delay" and "smslib.queue.retries" for this.
3. SMSLib: Added check-and-retry in case the CNMI detection fails (CMS ERROR 515). This failure may appear during initialization, when the modem does not have enough time to start up.
4. SMSLib: Added a WatchDog thread which is monitoring all gateways and restarts them if necessary.
5. SMSLib: The KeepAlive functionality is now "smart". If the Keep-Alive fails, it will mark the gateway appropriately and WatchDog will restart it.
6. SMSLib: InboundMessage.getPduUserData() was not working properly (http://code.google.com/p/smslib/issues/detail?id=41).
7. SMSLib: The Service class takes care of any timeouts/io errors during the Send/Read/Delete message operations and marks the appropriate gateways for restart.
8. SMSLib: Added settings class in SMSLib with all configurable parameters. See wiki: http://code.google.com/p/smslib/wiki/SMSLib_Parameters.
9. SMSSvr: New table "smssvr_calls" is required. SMSSvr now logs voice calls as well.
10. SMSLib: Changes for more detailed and informative logging.

12. SMSSvr: Tables names can now be parametrized via the configuration file.


[v3.1 Final - Dec 29, 2007]
1. SMSLib: Fixed RegEx to cater for private number callers (http://code.google.com/p/smslib/issues/detail?id=33).
2. SMSLib: Fixed some sync issues with the detection and handling of voice calls.
3. SMSLib: Forced receive threshold to 1 in SerialModemDriver.
4. SMSLib: Modifications for the handling of unsolicited events (synchronization issues).
5. SMSSvr: Better handling of initialization/startup exceptions.
6. SMSLib: Set the keep-alive interval to 60 seconds.


[v3.1 RC3 - Dec 20, 2007]
1. SMSLib: Added functionality to auto-detect the best CNMI command for the specific modem. Many thanks to Sebastian Just who contributed this class (CNMIDetector). Since this class is now in effect, several AT Handlers are now removed from the package.
2. SMSSvr: The priorities found in "smssvr_out" table were not correctly set in outbound message objects. Thanks to Sebastian Just for identifying this.
3. SMSLib: Incorrect sequence of events upon outbound queue failures can lead to messages staying in the queues forever.
4. SMSLib: Some characters were truncated when two-byte symbols are used (like the euro sign).
5. SMSLib: Changes in error handling (RegEx: ModemDriver.rxPlainError).
6. SMSLib: Changes in 7bit message encoding.
7. SMSLib: A new message type is introduced, the UNKNOWN. There is also a new class, derived from the InboundMessage, which is the UnknownMessage. Messages that are not recognized by SMSLib will be mapped to this objects. You can't really do much with these messages, but since they are mapped in objects, you can delete them in order to get out of the way.
8. SMSLib: Added an ESCAPE character in base ATHandler reset() method. This is to overcome the problem when the modem gets stuck during the sending of a message.
9. SMSLib: Added code to attempt restart for a Gateway that failed due to exceptions thrown in the background sender queue.
10. SMSSvr: SMSSvr will try to restart services when it encounters an exception.
11. SMSLib: Added ATHandler for Siemens MC35i. Thanks to Aleksandar Cosic for his assistance. **Warning** Some problems may still appear with this modem.
12. SMSLib: Added the configuration option "smslib.noportflush". When defined, the serial driver will not flush the port. Usefull in some cases where RxTx is used in Win32 platforms with virtual comm ports (http://code.google.com/p/smslib/issues/detail?id=31).
13. SMSSvr: Added the configuration option "smssvr.configfile". You can use this option to directly define the configuration file.
14. SMSLib: Added the configuration option "smslib.portpoll". This will enable the port polling mode. Please use this option instead of modifying the THREAD_READ constant in the source files.


[v3.1 RC2 - Dec 05, 2007]
1. SMSSvr: Support for MySQL. Added db creation scripts, added "database.type" in configuration file. Contributed by Maxwin (max@winsoft.hu).
2. SMSLib: Added code to ATHandler.reset() during initial connection.
3. SMSLib: Inbound message class is now set as public.
4. SMSLib: AGateway methods getQueueLoad() & getQueueLoad(MessagePriorities) are hidden. You can access these methods by the getGatewayQueueLoad() method (and its alternatives) �� the main Service class.
5. SMSLib: AGateway methods get/setQueueDelay() are hidden. You can access these methods by the get/setGatewayQueueDelay() method ofthe main Service class.
6. SMSLib: AGateway methods get/setQueueRetries() are hidden. You can access these methods by the get/setGatewayQueueRetries() method of the main Service class.
7. SMSLib: Added functionality for handling modems requesting SIM PIN2 as well. You will find a new setSimPin2() method in modem gateway. Contributed by Ally Rwegasira. **WARNING** The terminators array found in ATHandler.java has increased in length by one! Position 8 is now the SIM PIN 2 detection regexp. If you are using your own custom ATHandler with custom terminators' entries, you should adjust entries properly!
8. SMSLib: Changes in inbound voice call handler, should be more stable now.
9. SMSLib: File "smslib-log4j.properties" (constant Service.LOG4J_CONF) renamed to "smslib-log4j.properties".
10. SMSLib: A sample log4j properties file is included in "/other".
11. SMSLib: Added functionality to search for "smslib-log4j.properties" file in the classpath. Contributed by Anonymous (...@idim.com).
12. SMSLib: A new readMessage() method is introduced, which reads a specific Gateway for a message matching a specific Memory Location and Memory Index. This is *NOT* an implementation of the AT+CGMR command, but the net effect is the same.
13. SMSLib: The library will attempt to read messages even when the Storage related command (CPMS) fails. This does not guarantee correct operation but in certain cases may allow SMSLib to read your messages without throwing exceptions.
14. SMSLib: Removed the "SR" memory storage from the MultiTech handler, as its not applicable (http://code.google.com/p/smslib/issues/detail?id=26).
15. SMSSvr: All output is going through the SMSLib logger - direct print statements are removed.
16. SMSLib: Critical bug when splitting large messages resolved (http://code.google.com/p/smslib/issues/detail?id=27).
17. SMSLib: Some sync issues are resolved which seemed to affect operation in Linux/RxTx environments. Many thanks to Jeffrey Jongko for this extensive testing and reports.


[v3.1 RC1 - JDK1.4.2 compatible - November 21, 2007]
1. Fix of the work-around for the incorrect 7bit encoding which appended a "@" char. Code contributed by Lukasz Sasal.
2. SMSSvr: solved bug which didn't correctly read the retry count from the config file.
3. Gateway for ComVision SMS bulk operator ().
4. SMSSvr: the "settings.poll_interval" configuration is now express in seconds instead of minutes.
5. Default LoadBalancer for SMSLib is RoundRobinLoadBalancer().
6. SMSSvr:  now works in sync and async mode, as far as the sending is concerned. See new "settings.send_mode" configuration directive.
7. Added 57600 in the list of baud rate speeds tested by CommTest utility.
8. Both Queue Retries and Queue Delay parameters are now customizable via setters (AGateway class).
9. Package "org.smslib.routing" merged with "org.smslib".
10. Router class requires a Service object in its constructor.
11. Package "org.smslib.balancing" merged with "org.smslib".
12. LoadBalancer class requires a Service object in its constructor.
13. Package "org.smslib.athandlers" merged with "org.smslib".
14. Package "org.smslib.gateways" merged with "org.smslib".
15. Various library code changes.
16. Complete Documentation.
17. All methods throw named exceptions.
18. Custom SMSLib exceptions: SMSLibException, GatewayException, TimeoutException.
19. The Queue Manager was calling the Outboung callback method even during retries.
20. SMSSvr: various bug fixes.

28. Generics are gone - you are advised to use ArrayList when interactive with Service's methods.
29. SMSLib now checks for the system configuration option "smslib.queuedebug" (as well as "smslib.debug") in order to enable the modem queues' debug (extra debugging info).


[v3.0.4 - October 13, 2007]
1. Added forgotten "AT+COPS=0" during initialization. This missing command caused some GSM modems to report disabled network registration.
2. Added AT Handler for Ubinetics GDC201 (contributed by Sebastian Just).
3. OutboundWapSIMessage.Signals enumeration converted to upper case.
4. SMSSvr: Added new config items which set the allowed timeframes per message priorities. This way you can limit which messages are sent at which hours.

3. Fixed issue: http://code.google.com/p/smslib/issues/detail?id=1 The ModemGateway takes one more parameter,
	defining the type of modem in use. Alternatively, you can use the easily remembered "SerialModemGateway" &
	"IPModemGateway" classes which take care of the details.
4. Fixed issue: http://code.google.com/p/smslib/issues/detail?id=6
5. Fixed issue: http://code.google.com/p/smslib/issues/detail?id=3
