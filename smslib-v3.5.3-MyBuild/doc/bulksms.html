<h1>Bulk SMS Operators</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Apart from GSM modems or phones, SMSLib also supports some bulk SMS operators. These operators are companies which provide APIs and allow you to send SMS via their infrastructure. There are some notable pros and cons in using a bulk SMS operator instead of a simple GSM modem:</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster throughput: Using a bulk SMS company, you can send your messages much faster than when using a GSM modem.</li>
<li>Reliability: Bulk SMS companies may have redundant network connections available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliability: Bulk SMS companies are sometimes (or for some periods) blocked by national GSM providers due to spam.</li>
<li>Cost: The cost per message is a bit higher (but drops if you send out many messages).</li>
</ul>
<p>One way communication: Currently, SMSLib and bulk SMS companies can be used only for sending messages - you cannot receive messages via those companies. This is an SMSLib limitation.</p>
<p>In order to overcome all of the above limitations and combine the best of all worlds, you can also consider using both a GSM modem and a bulk SMS operator. The GSM modem can be used for receiving messages. On the other hand, you can forward all outbound messages via the bulk operator. SMSLib supports such a scenario.</p>
